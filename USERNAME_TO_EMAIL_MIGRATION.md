# Username to Email Migration Guide

## Overview

This update changes the authentication system from using `username` to `email` across the entire application. This change provides:

1. Better user identification with standard email addresses
2. Improved security with unique email addresses
3. Enhanced user experience with familiar login patterns

## Migration Steps

### 1. Database Migration

The database schema has been updated to replace the `username` column with an `email` column. To apply these changes, run:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

This command will:
- Drop and recreate all database tables (WARNING: This will erase all data)
- Update the schema to use email instead of username
- Prepare the system for the new authentication flow

### 2. Backend Changes

The following backend changes have been implemented:

- Updated the User model to use email instead of username
- Modified authentication controllers for login/register to use email
- Updated all API endpoints that reference username to use email
- Added email validation in the backend

### 3. Frontend Changes

The following frontend changes have been implemented:

- Updated login and registration forms to use email type inputs
- Added email validation in the frontend
- Changed all references from username to email in the UI
- Updated API service calls to send email instead of username

## User Impact

### Existing Users

Since this migration involves a schema change, all users will need to re-register with their email address. The previous username-based accounts will no longer be valid.

### New Users

New users will register directly with their email address and will not be affected by this change.

## Testing

Please test the following functionality after migration:

1. User registration with a valid email
2. User login with email and password
3. Admin user management (creating, viewing, editing users)
4. Any other flows that involve user authentication

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after migration:

1. Ensure the database migration completed successfully
2. Check for any error messages in the server logs
3. Verify that all forms are submitting the email field correctly
4. Ensure that the JWT token generation and validation are working properly
